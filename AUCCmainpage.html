		<h2>Captain: Jack Brickell<h2>

		<p>Jack Brickell is a spectacularly fluffy individual who secured the post of Captain by means of an alcohol induced promise to eat a pine cone. He’s a hairy hipster who came to us from a background of sprint kayaking and is therefore full of stylish moves despite often looking like the most scared individual on the river. Off the water, you might find Jack gallivanting in Invergarry with various ‘big deals’, nurturing his love affair for Canada, hipstering it up at a gig in suitably loud clothing or running around in the wild looking at rocks- always with an arsenal of sarcastic replies and quotes from various obscure films. Although this year it is more likely that his time will be consumed encouraging and babysitting the liability that is AUCC.</p>
